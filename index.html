    <h1>🎉 Happy 76th Birthday, Dad! 🎉</h1>

    <p>Wishing you a very happy birthday filled with good health and happiness. You have truly lived life in your own way — with confidence and peace — and that is something I really admire. You have not only been a wonderful father but also like a friend — always open, free, and ready to share and teach good things about life.</p>

    <p>You have taught me many valuable lessons — how to stay humble (something I am still learning from you), how to be happy with what we have, and how to only compete with ourselves — to become better, not to envy others.</p>

    <h2>Things We’ve Learnt from You</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Discipline:</b> You always keep your habits — taking a morning shower, praying, or doing <i>Suryanamaskar</i> before eating. The time may change, but you never miss it.</li>
      <li><b>Confidence:</b> You always believe in yourself. Even now, your famous line makes us smile — “Don’t worry, I will manage.”</li>
      <li><b>Interest & Passion:</b> You’ve shown us that when you love something, follow it — whether it’s cricket, politics, or anything else. We love how you still watch the same highlights again and again, saying, “Yaar yeh kahan dekha hai pata nahin, chalo dekhte hain.”</li>
      <li><b>Contentment:</b> You’ve taught us that it’s good to dream and improve, but never be jealous of others.</li>
      <li><b>Forgiveness:</b> You have a big heart and always choose to forgive and move on, even when something hurtful is said. You stay the same kind and calm person — that’s special.</li>
      <li><b>Kindness:</b> It’s amazing how you remember and pray for so many people. It shows your kind and good heart.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>And of course, we can’t forget your love for food! You’ve always shown how to enjoy a meal like a king and serve others with care. And yes — your little dessert tricks are the best:  
    <span class="sweet-note">“No no, I’ve only had one... okay maybe one last time!” 😄 (Teaching us negotiation skills to always get more and desire more!)</span></p>

    <div class="click-area" onclick="showMessage('Falafelllll! 😄')">Click here for a funny message</div>
    <div id="funMessage" class="message"></div>

    <script>
      function showMessage(msg) {
        const messageDiv = document.getElementById('funMessage');
        const messages = [
          "Falafelllll! 😄",
          "Bhulllaaa! 😂",
          "Chintaa Matttt Karrr! 💪",
          "Koi Nahin, Sab Thik Hai! 🙏",
          "Cricket Time! 🏏"
        ];
        // pick a random funny message
        const randomMsg = messages[Math.floor(Math.random() * messages.length)];
        messageDiv.textContent = randomMsg;
        messageDiv.style.display = 'block';
      }
