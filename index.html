    <h1>🎉 Happy 76th Birthday, Dad! 🎉</h1>

    <p>Wishing you a very happy birthday filled with good health and happiness. You have truly lived life in your own way — with confidence and peace — and that is something I really admire. You have not only been a wonderful father but also like a friend — always open, free, and ready to share and teach good things about life.</p>

    <p>You have taught me many valuable lessons — how to stay humble (something I am still learning from you), how to be happy with what we have, and how to only compete with ourselves — to become better, not to envy others.</p>

    <p>You have been a very successful family man, giving us good values and a happy life. Even with some ups and downs, you showed that if a small family is happy together, that’s all that really matters — though everyone else is always welcome too.</p>

    <h2>Things We’ve Learnt from You</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Discipline:</b> You always keep your habits — taking a morning shower, praying, or doing <i>Suryanamaskar</i> before eating. The time may change, but you never miss it.</li>
      <li><b>Confidence:</b> You always believe in yourself. Even now, your famous line makes us smile — “Don’t worry, I will manage.”</li>
      <li><b>Interest & Passion:</b> You’ve shown us that when you love something, follow it — whether it’s cricket, politics, or anything else. We love how you still watch the same highlights again and again, saying, “Yaar yeh kahan dekha hai pata nahin, chalo dekhte hain.”</li>
      <li><b>Contentment:</b> You’ve taught us that it’s good to dream and improve, but never be jealous of others.</li>
      <li><b>Forgiveness:</b> You have a big heart and always choose to forgive and move on, even when something hurtful is said. You stay the same kind
